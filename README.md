# Modular Discord Bot (SQL)
My Personal Modular Discord Bot that supports multiple Discord servers and SQL database access. Can hotswap commands into and out of system memory on the fly.

Still in developmental phases. This repository contains all the up to date code for the framework, and will remain public. Only the custom portions of the bot will be closed to the public.
